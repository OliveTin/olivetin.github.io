				<h2>Use case: <strong>Safely</strong> give access to commands, for less technical people;</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>eg: Give your family a button to <tt>podman restart plex</tt>
					<li>eg: Give junior admins a simple web form with dropdowns, to start your custom script. <tt>backupScript.sh --folder {{ customerName }}</tt></li>
					<li>eg: Enable SSH access to the server for the next 20 mins <tt>firewall-cmd --add-service ssh --timeout 20m</tt></li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Use case: <strong>Simplify</strong> complex commands, make them accessible and repeatable;</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>eg: Expose complex commands on touchscreen tablets stuck on walls around your house. <tt>wake-on-lan aa:bb:cc:11:22:33</tt></li>
					<li>eg: Run long running on your servers from your cell phone. <tt>dnf update -y</tt></li>
					<li>eg: Define complex commands with lots of preset arguments, and turn a few arguments into dropdown select boxes. <tt>docker rm {{ container }} && docker create {{ container }} && docker start {{ container }}</tt>
				</ul>

				<h2>Features</h2>

				<ul>
					<li><strong>Super simple config in YAML</strong> - because YAML is the future :-)</li>
<pre>
logLevel: "DEBUG"

</pre>
					<li><strong>Responsive</strong> - great for tablets and mobile, with a touch-friendly UI</li>
					<li><strong>Dark mode</strong> - for those of you that roll that way.</li>
					<li><strong>Accessible</strong> - passes all the accessibility checks in Firefox, and issues with accessibility are taken seriously.</li>
					<li><strong>Container</strong> - available for quickly testing and getting it up and running, great for the selfhosted community.</li>
					<li><strong>Integrate with anything</strong> - OliveTin just runs shell commands, so theoretially you could integrate with a bunch of stuff just by using curl, ping, etc. However, writing your own shell scripts is a great way to extend OliveTin.</li>
					<li><strong>Lightweight on resources</strong> - uses only a few MB of RAM and barely any CPU. Written in Go, with a web interface written as a modern, responsive, Single Page App that uses the REST/gRPC API.</li>
					<li><strong>Good amount of unit tests and style checks</strong> - helps potential contributors be consistent, and helps with maintainability.</li>
